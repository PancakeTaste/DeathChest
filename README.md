# DeathChest Minecraft Plugin

**Version:** 1.17

DeathChest is a Spigot plugin designed to enhance the player experience in Minecraft. When a player meets their demise, a chest automatically spawns at the exact location, containing their items for easy retrieval. Additionally, players with specific permissions (`deathc.tp`) can teleport directly to the chest.
